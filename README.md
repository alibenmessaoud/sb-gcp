# Spring Boot Deployment to Google Cloud Platform

This example project shows how to deploy a Spring Boot application to Google App Engine. Several blog posts explain the details:

- [Deploying Spring Boot Applications in the Google AppEngine Flex Environment](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2018/02/appengine-flex-spring-boot-deployment/)
- [Cloud Launcher for MongoDB in the Google Compute Engine](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2018/03/cloud-launcher-mongodb-google-compute-engine/)
- TBA

## MongoDB Setup
In order to run the application on your local machine you need a MongoDB server running on localhost:27017.
